* A custom keyboard layout for the Ergodox based on Workman
* Esc and CapsLock swapped ( Caps on L1 )
* Thumb Clusters mirrored on L2
* With a regular ergodox qwerty layout tucked away on layer 3 in case someone else needs to use your keyboard for a bit

Implementation via ergodox-ez configurator: http://configure.ergodox-ez.com/keyboard_layouts/krrvbg/
