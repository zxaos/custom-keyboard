* A custom keyboard layout for the Ergodox based on Halmak 2.2
* Modified to have classic Dvorak numbers
* With a regular ergodox qwerty layout tucked away on layer 3 in case someone else needs to use your keyboard for a bit


First pass implementation via ergodox-ez configurator: http://configure.ergodox-ez.com/keyboard_layouts/kppxal/
